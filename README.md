ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Daniela Frey!
ðŸ‘€ I love learning the "why", experiencing life fully, and being a part of something purposeful.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the language of SQL while pursuing a Data Analytics degree, exploring my passions for environmental sustainability and distaster relief, and working on my indoor/outdoor climbing skills!
ðŸ“« How to reach me: dfrey2003@icloud.com
âš¡ Fun fact: My top strength on the Gallup Assessment is Thinker. I'd say this is pretty accurate since I love researching before making decisions and finding out the "why" as mentioned earlier!
